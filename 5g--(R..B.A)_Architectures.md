# 5G Architecture by 3GPP

The 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project) encompasses telecommunication technologies, covering Radio Access Networks (RAN), core transport networks, and various service capabilities. 

The advent of 5G technology has expanded the scope of mobile networks to deliver a wide range of wireless services across diverse platforms and multi-layer networks.

The coexistence of human-centric and machine-type communications introduces diverse functional and performance requirements that 5G networks must support.

## Fundamental Pillars in 5G System (5GS):

- **End-to-End (E2E) Network Slicing:**
  - Allows the creation of virtualized network slices tailored for specific use cases.
  
- **Service-Based Architecture (SBA):**
  - A modular approach for service delivery, enhancing flexibility and scalability.
  
- **Software-Defined Networking (SDN):**
  - Network management through software applications, improving network control.
  
- **Network Functions Virtualization (NFV):**
  - Virtualizing network functions to increase agility and resource utilization.

These pillars form the foundation to efficiently support the heterogeneous Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) associated with new use cases in the 5G landscape. The 5G Reference Network Architecture, specified by 3GPP, is a non-roaming architecture.

## Network Nodes:

- **UE (User Equipment):**
  - 5G smartphones or cellular devices connecting over the 5G RAN to the 5G Core.
  
- **gNB (Next-Generation Node Base Station):**
  - 5G base station utilizing New Radio technology.
  - Utilizes Software-Defined Radio (SDR) with various MIMO capabilities.
  - Supports both Stand-Alone (SA) and Non-Stand-Alone (NSA) deployments.
  
- **5GC (5G Core):**
  - Core network with advanced functionalities, supporting cloud-native architecture.
  - Functionalities include Authentication, Security, Session Management, Traffic Aggregation, etc.

The 5G architecture includes several reference points (NG1 to NG15) that define interfaces between different network elements. Each reference point plays a crucial role in facilitating communication and coordination within the 5G network. Here is an overview of the key 5G interfaces:

1. **NG1:**
   - Reference point between the User Equipment (UE) and the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF).

2. **NG2:**
   - Reference point between the gNB and the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF).

3. **NG3:**
   - Reference point between the gNB and the User Plane Function (UPF).

4. **NG4:**
   - Reference point between the Session Management Function (SMF) and the User Plane Function (UPF).

5. **NG5:**
   - Reference point between the Policy Control Function (PCF) and an Application Function (AF).

6. **NG6:**
   - Reference point between the User Plane Function (UPF) and a Data Network (DN).

7. **NG7:**
   - Reference point between the Session Management Function (SMF) and the Policy Control Function (PCF).

8. **NG8:**
   - Reference point between the Unified Data Management (UDM) and the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF).

9. **NG9:**
   - Reference point between two Core User Plane Functions (UPFs).

10. **NG10:**
    - Reference point between the Unified Data Management (UDM) and Session Management Function (SMF).

11. **NG11:**
    - Reference point between the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) and Session Management Function (SMF).

12. **NG12:**
    - Reference point between the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) and Authentication Server Function (AUSF).

13. **NG13:**
    - Reference point between the Unified Data Management (UDM) and Authentication Server Function (AUSF).

14. **NG14:**
    - Reference point between two Access and Mobility Management Functions.

15. **NG15:**
    - Reference point between the Policy Control Function (PCF) and the Access and Mobility Management Function (AMF) in a non-roaming scenario, or between V-PCF and AMF in a roaming scenario.
