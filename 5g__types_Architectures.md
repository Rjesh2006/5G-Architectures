# 5G Architecture Overview

## Service-Based Architecture

In the dynamic realm of 5G architecture, the interaction between network operations is symbolized through a service-based or reference point representation. Described in a service-centric manner, network functions (NF) play a pivotal role as service producers, offering capabilities to authorized NF service consumers through meticulously designed service-based interfaces.

## Network Function Services

At the core of 5G's prowess lies the concept of Network Function Services. NF Service Producers act as virtuosos, endowing a spectrum of capabilities to their counterparts, the authorized NF Service Consumers. This orchestration takes place through service-based interfaces, unraveling multiple services, each adorned with a suite of procedures such as the nuanced choreography of NNRF MANAGEMENT and NBSF MANAGEMENT.

## Distinguishing 4G and 5G Network Architecture

| Feature                   | 4G Network                   | 5G Network                              |
|---------------------------|------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Generation                | Fourth-generation network    | Fifth-generation network                |
| Max Download Speed        | 1 Gbps                       | 2.5 Gbps                                |
| Max Upload Speed          | 500 Mbps                     | 1.25 Gbps                               |
| Network Architecture      | Traditional RAN              | C-RAN (Cloud Radio Access Network)      |
| Modulation Techniques     | QAM and QPSK                 | Amplitude Phase-Shift Keying (APSK)     |

## A Deeper Dive

- **Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN):** The grandeur of 5G unfolds with the utilization of Cloud Radio Access Network (C-RAN), an architectural marvel where the centralization of baseband processing ascends to cloud-borne heights. This not only augments efficiency but also propels internet speeds into the realms of the extraordinary.

- **Modulation Poetry:** Where 4G found its expression in poetic modulation techniques like QAM and QPSK, 5G is set to compose a new verse with the avant-garde notes of Amplitude Phase-Shift Keying (APSK), promising a symphony of more efficient data transmission.

The transition from 4G to 5G is not just a leap but a symphonic crescendo, heralding higher speeds, reduced latency, and an unparalleled connectivity tapestry. 5G emerges as the maestro orchestrating the harmonies of the future, weaving together the threads of IoT, AR, VR, and beyond.
